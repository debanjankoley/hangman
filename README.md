### Instructions

This is a command line Hangman game. The script randomly selects a word between 5 and 12 characters long from a file and you try to guess the word. After every guess the script displays which correct and incorrect letters have already been choosen and how many incorrect guesses are left.

In addition, you may choose to save the game. It will be saved in a save.yaml file and if a save file exists when you start the game it will ask you whether you want to load the saved game or not.
